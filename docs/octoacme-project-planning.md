# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. Engage QA Lead to draft initial test strategy and quality gates
8. Engage UX/UI Designer early if user-facing features are in scope
9. Consult DevOps Engineer on infrastructure, deployment, and CI/CD needs
10. Involve Technical Writer for documentation planning and release notes templates
