# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Ensure all roles are represented and heard:
  - Developers: code quality, technical debt, tooling
  - QA Lead: testing processes, quality gates, defect trends
  - UX/UI Designer: design feedback, user research insights, collaboration efficiency
  - DevOps Engineer: deployment reliability, infrastructure improvements, automation opportunities
  - Technical Writer: documentation gaps, knowledge sharing effectiveness
  - Product Managers: feature feedback, prioritization clarity
  - Project Managers: process efficiency, communication, coordination

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
- Encourage contributions from all roles:
  - QA Lead can propose testing automation or quality metrics improvements
  - DevOps Engineer can suggest infrastructure or deployment optimizations
  - UX/UI Designer can advocate for design system enhancements or usability research
  - Technical Writer can identify documentation process improvements or knowledge base gaps
